Welcome back, Mary Harrington. Tom Jones has hosted this event since 1997. This year's event offers you a private dinner with Tom Jones and even a chance to get a hug from him. Your meet and greet with Tom Jones is scheduled for August 26, 2025, in Youngstown, Ohio. Additional details are included on the ticket.

<br><br>

Your ticket provides authorized access to the event. As you were unable to attend the meet and greet last year, we have already refunded the full amount you paid for last year's ticket.
<br>
<br><br>

You can now purchase a ticket for this year's event. 
If you pay for the ticket promptly, it will be delivered much faster, as the event venue and time details will be printed on it, ensuring you don't miss this important information.

 This exclusive ticket costs $298. While this price might seem high, it would definitely be a worthwhile investment, as it grants you access to connect with Tom on a deeply personal level over a private, intimate dinner. To join the meet and greet, all you need to do is purchase the ticket.
